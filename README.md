This VBA code automates the extraction and transformation of data from specific sheets in an Excel workbook, focusing on information. It copies selected sheets' data, pastes it into a sample format sheet, and then creates new workbooks for each sheet, applying custom formatting. The code also clears unnecessary columns, adjusts column widths, and saves the new workbooks in a specified folder. The process is driven by predefined sheet names, custom file names, and sample format paths, providing a streamlined way to generate formatted files for different datasets.
